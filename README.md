## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Delegate handling of states which are not important (like a loading screen, or a 404 screen) to the directives and focus on what's more important (like building an aesthetically pleasing website).

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
git clone https://github.com/casualjsenthusiast/easy-directives.git
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Run the server locally

```
ng serve --open
```

Add directive to your html component and pass input to it. The following piece of code will display a loading component until the condition is true. Here `wc` and `lc` are the inputs to the `LoadingDirective`.
```
<div *appLoading="true; wc: 'class1'; lc: 'class2'">
  This paragraph is not displayed because the condition is true.
</div>
```

## Directives

### Structural
Directives that modifies the structure of dom elements

#### LoadingDirective

**Usage:**
```html
<div *appLoading="true">
  This paragraph is not displayed because the condition is true.
</div>
```

To modify styles of the loading component, pass string of classes as an input to the directive
```typescript
const wrapperDivClasses = 'class1 class2';
const loaderDivClasses = 'class3 class4';
```
and then in the html, pass input in the following manner
```html
<div *appLoading="true; wc: wrapperDivClasses; lc: loaderDivClasses">
  (A) This paragraph is displayed because the condition is false.
</div>
```
